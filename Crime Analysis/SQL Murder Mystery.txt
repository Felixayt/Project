PROBLEM: A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use SQL to navigate through this vast network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database. Below we'll explain from a high level the commands you need to know; whenever you are ready, you can start adapting the examples to create your own SQL commands in search of clues -- you can run any SQL in any of the code boxes, no matter what was in the box when you started.






/*First, using the available information I queried the crime scene report 
filter down to SQL city and crime type to get more infomation on the witness*/

SELECT *
FROM CRIME_SCENE_REPORT
WHERE type = 'murder' AND city ='SQL City';

-- Next, I followed my first lead(the witness) to get the report of their eye witness account

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE'%Annabel%' AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave' 
ORDER BY address_number DESC;

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name ='Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1;

/* Then I joined both persons and interview table
using the person_id of our witnesses to get the transcript of the eye witness report*/

SELECT *
FROM interview i
join person p
ON i.person_id = p.id
WHERE id IN (16371,14887);

/*I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. 
The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out 
last week on January the 9th.*/



SELECT * 
FROM Get_fit_now_member
WHERE id LIKE '%48Z%' AND membership_status = 'gold';

--From our first witness we have been able to narrow down our search to two suspects
--Next we will use the join tables

SELECT *
FROM Get_fit_now_member g
JOIN person p
ON g.person_id = p.id
JOIN drivers_license d
ON d.id =p.license_id
WHERE g.person_id IN (67318,28819)
AND plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

/*Now we will need to cross check witness 1 description with the 
gym attendance of our suspect on 9th January based on witness 2 report*/

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id = '48Z55';

--We found our first suspect 'JEREMY BOWERS' as he fits into the description

SELECT * 
FROM Get_fit_now_member
WHERE id LIKE '%48Z%' AND membership_status = 'gold';

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id = '48Z7A';

--Next, we will also use the vehicle registration to verify our suspect using joins

SELECT *
FROM Get_fit_now_member g
JOIN person p
ON g.person_id = p.id
JOIN drivers_license d
ON d.id =p.license_id
WHERE g.person_id IN ('67318', '28819')
AND plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';


/*SELECT person_id, count(*)
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE date between 20171201 and 20171231
AND event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING count(person_id) >= 3;*/


-- Lets look at the interview record for the suspect information to uncover the crime details

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id IN ( '28819', '67318');

/*I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but
I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a
Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.*/


/*Next we will use joins and CTE to query the facebook event checkins, drivers license 
 and persons table to identify the woman who hired the suspect*/
 
 
WITH suspect_hire 
AS (SELECT person_id, count(*)
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE date between 20171201 and 20171231
AND event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING count(person_id) >= 3)

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license d
JOIN person p
ON d.id = p.license_id
JOIN suspect_hire sh 
ON p.id = sh.person_id
WHERE d.car_make = 'Tesla' AND d.car_model LIKE '%S%' AND d.gender = 'female' 
AND d.hair_color = 'red'

AND d.height between 65 AND 67;

THE MURDER IS MIRANDA PRIESTLY.
